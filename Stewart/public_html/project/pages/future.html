    <h3>Why I picked UNH Air Force</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I picked UNH as I had to decide between UNH and Norwich University<br>
        The sites are the following.<br><a herf="https://www.unh.edu">UNH Website</a><br>
        <a herf="https://www.norwich.edu">Norwich University's Website</a><br>
        I wanted to have a more normal college experience then going to a military university.
        I will have plenty of time to have military experience. I'm already doing Air Force ROTC here at UNH.<br><a
