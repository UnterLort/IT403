    <h3>Why? Whats the plan?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>My plan is to hopfully go into the Air Force as an officer with the help of Air Force ROTC.<br>

            herf="https://www.afrotc.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKurBhD5ARIsALamXaFzQDsJkCXt_Yh4YxrFitQXIor0u1a4GPd8CAvwcNlyx4w3SLyFGtkaAlb1EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">Air
            Force ROTC Website</a><br>The first job I am looking to go into is cybersecrity as an officer. <a

            Officer Website</a>
        Once I do as much time as I can to get as much benefits and rank as I can from the miltary I will probably try
        and work in a federal level job as I will have the experience and security clearance.

    <h3>Is it just Air Force?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The main plan is Air Force. However I have had experience with the Marines in high school.<br>
        I won't go Marines they just don't suit me. However I am between Air Force and Space Force.<br>
        Both would be the same job but I have heard I will go up the ranks faster in the Space Force but it all depends
        on all the benefits at the end of the day between them two.<br>
