    <h3>Armed Forces Code of Conduct I. - VI.</h3>
    <br>
    <h5>I.</h5>
    <p>I am an American, fighting in the forces, which guard my country and our way of life. I am
        prepared to give my life in their defense.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>II.</h5>
    <p>I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender the members of
        my command while they still have the means to resist.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>III.</h5>
    <p>If I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make every effort to
        escape and aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>IV.</h5>
    <p>If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no
        information nor take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am senior I
        will take command. If not I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over me and back them up in every
        way.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>V.</h5>
    <p> when questioned, should I become a prisoner of war, I am required to give name, rank, service
        number, and date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability. I will make no
        oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful to their cause.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>VI.</h5>
    <p>I will never forget that I am an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my actions, and
        dedicated to the principles which made my country free. I will trust in my God and in the United States of
        America.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Core Values</h3>
    <h5>Integrity First</h5>
    <p>Integrity is acting in a manner that is consistent and uncompromised to a set of principles in both
        professional and private spheres of life. Persons of integrity do not make choices based on what
        is popular or most advantageous to themselves but rather on what most closely aligns to the
        posterity of their internalized principles.</p>

    <h5>Service Before Self</h5>
    <p>The first three words of the U.S. Constitution, for which military members swear (or affirm) to
        support and defend are these: “We the People”. People are the most critical asset to national
        defense, and the very reason for which military members serve. To serve selflessly resists the
        natural tendency to focus on self-interests and, therefore, do not take advantage of situations for
        personal gain, pleasure, or safety. Unity and cohesiveness are generated where there is a willingness to share
        in the danger, hardships, and discomforts in order to promote common welfare of a group.</p>

    <h5>Excellence in All We Do</h5>
    <p>To remain the world's preeminent air force, Airmen make a lifelong commitment to developing a sustained passion
        for continuous improvement and innovation. Persons of excellence continuously venture outside their comfort
        zones and seek out ways to expand their knowledge
        and experience. These individuals' welcome feedback and constructive criticism and are not
        afraid to recognize their weaknesses and find ways to mitigate them. They base their self -esteem and sense of
        accomplishment not on how they compare with others but on the magnitude and longevity of their actions' impact.
