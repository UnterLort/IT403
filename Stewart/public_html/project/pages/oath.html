    <h3>The Airman's Creed</h3>
    <p>I am an American airman.
        <br>
        I am a warrior
        <br>
        I have answered my nation's call.
        <br>
        I am an American airman.
        <br>
        My mission is to fly, flight and win.
        <br>
        I am faithful to a proud heritage, a tradition of honor, and a legacy of valor.
        <br>
        I am an American airman,
        <br>
        guardian of freedom and justice, my nation's sword and shield, its sentry and avenger.
        <br>
        I defend my country with my life.
        <br>
        I am an American airman
        <br>
        wingman, leader, warrior.
        <br>
        I will never leave an airman behind,
        <br>
        I will never falter,
        <br>
        and I will not fail.
